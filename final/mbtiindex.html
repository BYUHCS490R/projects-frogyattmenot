            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or also known as, MBTI, is a one of the most popular personality test put there. The way the test functions is that it sorts people into 16 personality types based on how they perceive the world and make decisions. It is developed using Carl Jung's ideas about about psychological preferences and uses four key pairs - for example, extraversion versus introversion - to describe one's natural style. Although it is widely used for self-understanding and career development, psychologists often debate its scientific accuracy.
