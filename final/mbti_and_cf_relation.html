        <h2>How does MBTI and Cognitive Functions relate to each other?</h2>
        <p>MBTI and cognitive functions are related to each other because the four-letter MBTI type is basically a simplified “summary,” while the cognitive functions explain how the mind of that type actually works. Each and every MBTI type uses four specific functions (ex: Ne, Fi, Ti, or Si) in a fixed order that determines how they perceive the world and make decisions. The MBTI letters (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) tell you which functions a person uses and whether their strongest function is introverted or extraverted. In other words, MBTI describes personality preferences on the surface, while the cognitive functions reveal the deeper mental processes behind those preferences.

        <h3>Understanding The Function Stacks</h3>

        <h4>The Hierarchy of The Cognitive Functions</h4>
        <p>Your function stack determines which cognitive tools you naturally reach for first when processing information or making decisions. The functions are arranged in four positions, each playing a distinct role in your personality:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dominant Function (1st Position)</li>
            <li>Auxiliary Function (2nd Position)</li>
            <li>Tertiary Function (3rd Position)</li>
            <li>Inferior Function (4th Position)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>1. Dominant Function (1st Position)</strong></p>
        <p>This is your primary way of interacting with world. It is the function that has been developed since childhood and is the most used naturally. Your dominant function is your greatest strength and requires little to no effort when you use it. For example, for extroverts, the dominant function is directed outward towards the external world while for introverts, it's focused inward on their internal world.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Auxiliary Function (2nd Position)</strong></p>
        <p>The auxiliary function acts as a support that balances the dominant function. If your dominant function is introverted, your auxiliary function will be extraverted (and vice versa). This ensures that you can still engage with both your inner and outer world (balance is still needed!). Your auxiliary function develops during your childhood and youth, becoming more developed as you mature. This helps add depth to your personality, making it more rounded and prevents you from being one-dimensional.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Tertiary Function (3rd Position)</strong></p>
        <p>Your tertiary function is less than developed than your first two functions. It typically emerges more full in adulthood. It operates in the same orientation (introverted or extraverted) as your dominants function. Many people experience this function as a source of relaxation or creative exploration—it is familiar enough to be accessible but different enough to feel refreshing.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Inferior Function (4th Position)</strong></p> 
        <p>This is your least developed function. Your inferior function operates in the opposite orientation from your dominant. The inferior function represents your psychological growing edge. It is where you are most vulnerable to stress but also where significant personal development can occur later in life. Under pressure, your inferior function can “take over” in problematic ways, but learning to integrate it healthily is a key aspect of psychological maturity.</p>

        <p>In summary, the function stack provides a framework for understanding how different cognitive processes are prioritized and developed within each of the 16 personality types. By recognizing the roles of each function in your stack, you can gain deeper insights into your personality dynamics and the areas that could be improved for growth.</p>
