        <h2>1. Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h2>
        <p>Inline is basically adding attributes into your tag. It is the next priority after the html attributes.</p>
        <p>Embedded is about adding the style tag in the head tag. It cannot go into the body tag. It is also the next priority after the inline.</p>
        <p>External can be overwritten by inline and embedded css. It can be done by creating a css file and then linking both html file with the css file by either using relative or absolute path. It is also the last priority and cascading.</p>
        <h2>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h2>
        <p>Why not use inline and embedded? That is because we, the programmer, are just in charge of doing the html. The graphic designer's job is to make the css file. Us adding the the inline will override their work. If it's not uniform, the webpage will not look good. Only one css file is shared in all the webpages.</p>
        <h2>3. What is a selector used for?</h2>
        <p>It is used to decide which part of the html tags will get the css effect or applied to them. There many types of selectors.</p>
        <p>Note: Cascading is about prioritizing.</p>
