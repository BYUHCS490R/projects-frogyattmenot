    <h1>Engagement - Git and GitHub Help</h1>
    <h2>1. How do you get help?</h2>
    <p>The way I get help is by taking advantage of the resources given in canvas. I also ask the Professor some questions.</p>
    <h2>2. What time are engagement assignments due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?</h2>
    <p>The time the engagement assignments are due is at 11:59pm. I cannot turn them in late. I will lose lots of marks if I miss one.</p>
    <h2>3. What time are projects due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?</h2>
    <p>The time the projects are due is 11:59pm. I cannot turn them in late. I will lose lots of marks if I were to miss one.</p>
    <h2>4. Describe the tags we discussed today. Remember, you can look at the lecture notes for a video that reviews<br> what we discussed.</h2>
