        <h2>Absolute Link</h2>
        <p>In President Russel M. Nelson's talk, he talked about peace
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng">here</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <a href="engagement2.html">Previous engagement activity</a>
        <h2>1. What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h2>
        <p>The root is the primary or main link that contains all the projects without any path. For example, http://127.0.0.1:3000. The folder and file names are part of the path. That path starts from the first slash after the root.</p>
        <h2>2. What is a default document?</h2>
        <p>It is the main page that you want your user to see. Each page has its own default document. We don't want the users to see our wjhole entire projects like http://127.0.0.1:3000. Instead, to make the main default page, we need to make a new file named index.html. </p>
        <h2>3. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p>Absolute link is the link to redirect the users to an external website that is not made by the dev. Relative link is the link that redirects users to another website that is made by the dev. It is usually in the navigation tag. Relative links are usually used to send the users to another page.</p>
        <h2>4. List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h2>5. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>Not necessarily. They can be anywhere.</p>
