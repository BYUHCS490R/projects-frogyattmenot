        <h2>1. Please describe the parent-child relationship in HTML and why it becomes essential when using flex and grid.</h2>
        <p>The parent-child relationship refers to any block tags can be a parent box or child box. Can also see this in a family tree way. Box that contain boxes.</p>
        <h2>2. What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
        <p>CSS grid refers to to a grid-based layout with rows and columns. It allows developers to create a complex web layout. It also makes it easy for developers to create a responsive layout that is adaptable without having to use float or positioning. Flex is way easier to do. Grid is two dimensional and is more strict like the parent is commanding the child. Meanwhile, flex is more to like the parent asking the children.</p>

        <h2>Examples:</h2>

        <div class="parent">
            <p class="child">i am child one</p>
            <p class="child">i am child two</p>
            <p class="child">i am child three</p>
        </div>
        <!--to seperate, we can do either gap in the parent or margin in the child-->
