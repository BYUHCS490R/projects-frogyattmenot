  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>UL and OL are list tags. You can't put other tags aside from LI inside it.</li>
    <li>type="" can only be used in ordered list for the list attributes.</li>
    <li>Need to be wary with two browsers: chrome and firefix. This is due to its rendering engine. These two have different rendering engine.</li>
