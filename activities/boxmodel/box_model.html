        <h2>1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h2>
        <p>Block tags are tags that forms a box. They start a new line and take up the full available width. As for inline tags, they do not start a new line and only take up the necessary width for the content. They are mostly used within the block tags for things like styling or marking.</p>
        <h2>2. What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
        <p>Mergin is the space outside the box. Padding is the space inside the box. Border is the line that goes around the element or the box, which can be invisible or visible.</p>
        <h2>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
        <p>Pixels is the most common.</p>
        <h2>4. When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
        <p>Figure tag is just a block tag that you can put a image in it.</p>

        <h2>Additional notes</h2>
        <p>By default, h1 already has a padding applied to it.</p>
