            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Promised Neverland is a captivating manga series turned anime that was created by Kaiu Shirai with Posuka Demizu as the illustrator. The story revolves around Emma, Ray, and Norman whom are the smartest kids living at an orphanage. Everything was perfect that many people would initially thought that it would be a slice of life anime. Of course, they were wrong. This orphanage that they were living in is not an ordinary one. It has a dark secret. One that includes livestock. This propels them into a high-stakes game of survival. The series has expanded into a popular anime adaptation, a live-action film, and even a mobile game, each adding new layers to the original narrative.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>I love the Proimised Neverland! It is such good blend of many themes like dark fantasy, science fiction and thriller. The visuals are also beautiful both in the anime and manga. The voice actors also voiced them really well. My main complaint though was the second season of the anime. They skipped many manga arcs! For example, the goldpond arc. The goldypon arc is one of the best arcs not only because of the fighting scenes but also because of the characters. We got to explore of the characters in depth and see how determined they are. It is one of the most inspiring arcs. So I was disappointed with the season 2. Overall, in the manga, I love it!</p>
