    <h2>1. Five Nights At Freddy's</h2>
    <p>FNAF or Five Nights At Freddy's is a video game series and media franchise that has been created independently by Scott Cawthon, which includes video games, graphic novels, and films. It is an independent point-and-click survival horror video game. I love the lore of this game so much and I also love how many fans came up with lots of theories regarding the storyline of the game. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay</u></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In this game, we, the player, are playing as the security guard of the fictional Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant, Mike Schmidt. The main objective of the game is to survive a whole shift from 12am until 6am in the morning (several minutes in real-time) for five nights. While doing so, the player also has to be very attentive to their surroundings to make sure to avoid the animatronics that will roam around the restaurant during the player's shift. As the night goes on, things will get harder and harder for the player to protect themselves and prevent the animatronics from entering the office. Failure to avoid the animatronics will result in the animatronics entering the office and jumpscare the player, taking them to the Game Over screen before being brought back to the title screen.</p>
    <h2>2. Undertale</h2>
    <p>Undertale is a role-playing game that was created independently by Toby Fox that utilizes many genre mechanics, albeit differently. The game centers around a child, the player, whom has fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth at Mount Ebott, separated by a magical barrier. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay</u></h3>
     <p style="text-align: center;">Throughout the game, the child, or the player, will navigate their way back to the surface world and will eventually encounter various monsters, some of which may engage in combat. They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes as there will be 3 routes: Pacifist, Neutral, and Genocide. </p>
     <h2>3. Mouthwashing</h2>
     <p>Mouthwashing is a psychological horror indie game that was developed by Wrong Organ. This game is played from a first-person perspective and it follows the story of five crew members of the freighter spaceship <em>Tulpar</em> after a mysterious crash, leaving them stranded in space, trapped within the Tulpar as supplies dwindle.</p>
     <h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay</u></h3>
     <p style="text-align: center;">Mouthwashing is a game that uses a split, nonlinear narrative. It is a single-player adventure game that is not really in the way of survival and combat mechanics like the typical adventure game. Instead, this game primarily involves exploring the Tulpar, engaging in dialogue with the crew, and solving puzzles using items. It is more of a story-based game that includes walking simulator. The story of this game is one of the best. It is basically about taking responsibilty.</p>
