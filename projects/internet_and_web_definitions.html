    <h1>What are some internet and web definitions?</h1>
    <h2>1. Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet is defined as a global network that connects devices like phones, computers <br>
        and others so that information can be shared faster and more efficiently. 
        It is akin to that <br> of a "highway" that makes things like email, online games, video calls and websites possible.</p>
    <h2>2. Web (World Wide Web or WWW)</h2>
    <p>The web is a collection of websites, web pages, videos and images that can be seen by the <br>
        users through browser like Google Chrome and Safari. It works through the internet to deliver <br>
        information to the users.</p>
    <h2>3. How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet is a physical network, like the roads, cables, and systems tha connects or <br>
        links everything together. Meanwhile, the web is just one service that uses the internet, <br>
        like cars driving on roads. The internet is bigger than the web. Thus, without the internet, <br>
        the web wouldn't exist.</p>
    <h2>4. ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII is an older system that only has 128 possible characters, which represents basic English <br>
        letters, numbers, and symbols. Unicode on the other hand, is a much more modern system that <br>
        could represent almost every character in every language, including emojis and symbols, <br>
        making this system much more advanced, powerful, and universal.</p>
    <h2>5. UTF-8</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 is a method of storing Unicode characters that are using between 1 and 4 bytes. It is <br>
        said to be smart because English letters usually take like up to 1 byte (For example, ASCII). <br> 
        It can also handle thousands of symbols and languages. That is the reason why UTF-8 is the <br>
        most commonly used text encoding on the web.</p>
    <h2>6. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2> 
    <p>A URL is simply the address of something on the web. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki <br>
        /Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s is the address that takes the user to the Five Nights At Freddy's <br> 
        Wikipedia website. Without the URL, the computer wouldn't where to go.</p>
    <h2>7. Domain Name</h2>
    <p>A domain name is human-friendly version of an address. Instead of typing a long number like <br>
        172.217.14.206, we can just type the domain name, which is google.com. The domain name makes <br>
        it easier for people to access websites.</p>
    <h2>8. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h2>
    <p>HTTP is a set of rules that lets a user's web browser and a website's server talk to each other <br>
        When the user clicks on a link, the HTTP will tell the user's browser how to request the page <br>
        and how to display it once received.</p>
    <h2>9. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</h2>
    <p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. Th reason is because it adds encryption so that the user's <br>
        personal data and information are safe from anyone who wants to spy or steal the personal <br>
        information the user sends such as credit card details and passwords. That is why modern <br>
        websites almost always use HTTPS.</p>
    <h2>10. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)</h2>
    <p>An IP address is like the "home address" of a device on a network. Every computer or phone needs <br>
        an IP address so that data knows where to go. For example, when the user visits a website, their <br>
        computer uses the website's IP address to connect to it.</p>
    <h2>11. DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
    <p>The way the DNS works is like a phonebook for the internet. When the user types in a domain name <br>
        like facebook.com, DNS will then translate it into an IP address of the computer where the website <br>
        is stored. This way, the user doesn't have to remember long numbers.</p>
    <h2>12. W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>The W3C or the World Wide Web Consortium is a group that comes up with rules or standards for how the <br>
        web should work. Their recommendations make sure that websites have the same appearance and behaviour <br> 
        no matter what browser or device the user uses</p>
    <h2>13. XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>- XML is a type of language that stores and share data in a clean and structured way.<br>
       - XHTML is just HTML but written in a stricter way that follows the XML rules.<br>
       - HTML is the language the user uses to build websites by organizing text, images, <br>
       appearance and links<br>
       - HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It supports modern features like videos, and <br>
       interactive content directly in the browser without extra software.</p>
