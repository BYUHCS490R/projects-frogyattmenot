        <h1 style="text-align: center;" class="name"><u>Scott Cawthon</u></h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Scott Braden Cawthon is an American video game developer, writer and producer. He is best known for developing the popular horror game series, <em>Five Nights At Freddy's,</em> which expanded into a media franchise. Scott is also an animator, author, screenwriter, and film producer. He is born on June 4, 1978 (age 47) in Houston, Texas, U.S. He is also known as Animdude.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Scott Cawthon began his career developing family-friendly Christian video games but with little success. He then transitioned to making horror games starting with the first Five Nights at Freddy's game, which was a huge success and gained lots of fans. The game was such a commercial success that many fans came made fanarts, fanfictions, gameplay videos, fan songs and fan games. Even for the first FNAF film that was released in the year 2023, they included one of the fan songs as the end credits song, which was <em>Five Nights At Freddy's</em> by The Living Tombstone.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Scott Cawthon is one of my biggest inspirations. He is one of the people that inspires me to be passionate in computer science and robotics.</p>
